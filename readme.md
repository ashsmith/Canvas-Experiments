# Canvas Experiments.

This is my first attempt at playing around with HTML5 canvas. What I hope to build over time is a nice little collection of various data visualisation experiments built purely using jQuery/Cavnas.

Ideas for data visualisations:

  - Line graph (in progress)
  - Bar Graph
  - Pie chart
  - Box & Whisker
  - Spider Graph

I would have given up and downloaded something pre-made if it wasn't for the awesomeness listed below:
