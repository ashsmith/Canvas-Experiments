# Canvas Experiments.

This is my first attempt at playing around with HTML5 canvas. What I hope to build over time is a nice little collection of various data visualisation experiments built purely using jQuery/Cavnas.

Ideas for data visualisations:

  1. Line graph (in progress)
  2. Bar Graph (in progress)
  3. Pie chart
  4. Box & Whisker
  5. Spider Graph


###Resources, Inspiration & Credits
I would have given up and downloaded something pre-made if it wasn't for the awesomeness listed below:

  - [Draw a Line Graph using HTML5 Canvas (Tutorial)][1] by [World Wide What][2]
  - [HTML5 Canvas Cheat Sheet][3] by [Nihilogic][4]
  
A huge thanks goes to those resources above.
